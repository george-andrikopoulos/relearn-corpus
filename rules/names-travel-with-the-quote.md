Before an incident, a log line, a trace or a path leaves the repository that holds it,
scan the destination with the source's own detector -- not the destination's.

A detector for private identifiers is scoped to a tree. It is a list of names somebody
enumerated, matched against the files of one repository, and it is correct exactly there.
Every quotation moves content across that boundary and none of it moves the check: the
paper, the public rule corpus, the issue comment and the conference slide each inherit
the source's *names* and none of its *gates*. The source stays green, because nothing
about it changed.

The trap is that writing the incident down is the discipline working. A rule with no
provenance cannot be audited, so the incident narrative is mandatory -- and a narrative
is verbatim by nature, because the specifics are what make it interpretable. The very
field that makes a correction durable is the one that carries the name out.

So the check belongs at the boundary the content crosses, which is the publication, not
the repository. Where the destination is public, the term list usually cannot be
committed alongside it: a salted digest of a short name is a few million candidates and
publishing the list discloses what it detects. Keep the matcher in the public artefact
and the list outside it, and make the absence of the list an ERROR rather than a pass, or
the gate arrives disarmed and reports the same green as a clean tree
`[R:guarantee-needs-a-reader]`.

Failure-mode check, before anything private is quoted anywhere: **which repository's
detector covers the file I am about to write into?** If the answer is the repository the
quotation came FROM, nothing covers the destination.

This is the sibling of `[R:report-the-hit-not-the-match]`, which governs the moment a
search prints what it found. That one is about output; this one is about content coming
to rest in a second artefact, where it is committed, pushed, indexed and mirrored. Same
identifier, different surface, and the fixes do not substitute for one another.
