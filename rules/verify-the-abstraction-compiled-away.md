"Zero-cost" is a property of a particular abstraction, under a particular optimiser, on a particular build profile. In Rust it is usually true, which is precisely why it gets asserted instead of checked, and why the cases where it is false survive review.

Where the cost is load-bearing -- a hot path, a latency budget, an allocation-free claim -- look at what was emitted. `cargo asm` for the function, `cargo bloat` for the binary, a benchmark on the profile that actually ships. A debug build proves nothing about a release binary: a newtype that is free at `opt-level = 3` need not be at `opt-level = 0`, and the two are different programs.

Then run the failure-mode check R:measure-cost-per-task states in the general case -- under what configuration does this cost exactly what it was chosen not to cost? A `#[repr(transparent)]` newtype crossing an FFI boundary, an iterator chain that fails to fuse because the closure captures by reference, a generic that is never monomorphised because it went out through a trait object. Bound that configuration, or drop the claim.

This is R:verify-through-production-path applied to code generation: a claim measured on a build the user never runs is evidence about that build alone. Where the cost is not load-bearing, do not make the claim at all -- an unverified performance assertion in a doc comment is read as a measured one.
