The practice: a constraint expressed about the machine is not discharged by a decision about a dependency, and recording it as met at the wrong layer is worse than leaving it open, because an open constraint still gets looked at."

State which layer a requirement lives at before choosing anything, and satisfy it there.

A requirement about the machine -- do not perturb a neighbouring isolated core, do not
fault a page on the send path, do not take a lock a real-time thread contends for -- is
not answered by picking a faster crate, a better-reputed transport, or an asynchronous
API. Those are library-level decisions. They may be correct and they may even help, but
they do not *hold* a systems-level constraint, and treating them as though they do
converts an open question into a closed one with nothing behind it.

The failure is not the wrong choice; it is the wrong ledger entry. A constraint marked
satisfied stops being examined. An open constraint is still visible to the next person,
which makes leaving it open strictly better than closing it at a layer that cannot keep
it.

So name the layer explicitly, then name what holds the requirement there: a CPU affinity
mask, an isolated core list, a memory policy, a pre-faulted and locked mapping, a thread
priority, a cgroup. If the answer to "what holds this?" is the name of a library, the
requirement is unheld.

Two rules meet here and neither subsumes this one. `[R:measure-cost-per-task]` governs
*how to choose* a mechanism -- by what it actually costs and touches, never by
reputation -- and its failure-mode check asks under what configuration the mechanism
causes the exact harm it was chosen to prevent. That check is necessary and it is not
sufficient: a mechanism can pass it and still be the wrong layer to have asked at.
`[R:guarantee-needs-a-reader]` is the general form of the ledger failure -- a claim with
nothing reading the state it asserts -- and this is the shape that claim takes when the
state in question is a property of the machine rather than of the code.

Then run the pass the sibling rule requires: `[R:attack-the-design-in-a-second-pass]`
exists because the person who chose the mechanism is the last person able to see that
they answered at the wrong layer.
