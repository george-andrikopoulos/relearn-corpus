A fresh-reader sweep then found fifteen more of the same kind: a cross-reference to a section that had moved, a count of items that no longer matched the list beneath it, an antecedent whose noun had been renamed. Each was individually invisible to the author, because a writer re-reads what they meant rather than what is there, and every one was produced by an edit that was correct in itself."

Editing a structured artefact silently breaks references that the previous version made true. The edit raises no error, and rereading does not catch it: the author restores the deleted context from memory and reads a coherent passage that is not on the page.

So run referential integrity as a **distinct pass**, after the restructuring and not during it. Every pronoun and comparative -- *this*, *neither*, *the former*, *the more important* -- must resolve within the current text. Every cross-reference must point where it claims. Every announced count must match what follows. Every term must be defined before it is used.

Two methods defeat author blindness where rereading cannot. Give the passage to a fresh reader instructed to report **comprehension failures only**, not content or style -- they have no deleted draft to autocomplete from. Or translate it into another language: if it cannot be rendered without adding words, the words are missing in the original.

Prefer structure that cannot carry the defect. A heading that states a count goes stale on the next addition, so write the heading without the count rather than remembering to update it -- R:prefer-by-construction applied to prose.

This is the prose sibling of R:wired-artifact: a locally correct change with a silent non-local effect. Ask, every time: *what did this edit quietly leave pointing at nothing?*
