The repository synchronised between both kinds, so the case-insensitive semantics were the binding constraint and one document was quietly overwriting the other.

Before creating any file, check for an existing sibling whose name differs only by case or by Unicode normalisation. Where a repository is synced between a case-sensitive filesystem and a case-insensitive one, the case-insensitive semantics are the binding constraint: two such names are one file, and the loser is whichever was written second.

Merge into the existing file, with a section heading, rather than creating the colliding name. The instinct to create a properly-capitalised new file is the failure -- the convention is not worth a silent overwrite on the other machine.

The damage is invisible from where the work was done. On the authoring filesystem both files exist and everything looks correct; the collision appears only after a sync, as content that vanished with no diff and no error to attribute it to.

This rule has graduated: a write-time hook now blocks the collision deterministically, so the instruction layer no longer has to carry it for that path. It still applies to every creation path the hook does not see -- a shell redirect, a git operation, another tool -- which is why the guidance is kept rather than retired.
