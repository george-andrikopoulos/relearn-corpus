When what you are searching for is a thing whose whole problem is that it exists, your
search output is another copy of it. Report **location, count and length**; never the
matched text, and never a field that can contain it.

Run the check before the output leaves your hands: *for every field I am about to print
-- path, parent directory, filename, context line, error message, commit summary -- can
the thing I am hiding be inside it?* If you cannot answer for one of them, drop that
field. A path whose last component IS the name defeats a redaction that prints the
parent, and `find | xargs` prints the path whole.

**This binds ad-hoc work exactly as it binds a committed detector, and that is the half
that fails.** A one-off shell pipeline, a `grep -o`, a loop written to answer one
question, and the sentence you type afterwards are all publication surfaces -- and so is
the transcript. A carefully built scanner in the same repository does not cover you; it
covers its own output.

Sibling, deliberately not merged: `[R:detector-excludes-own-definitions]` is the
FALSE-POSITIVE half of self-reference -- a check that matches its own text is always red,
gets muted, and leaves the system looking guarded. This is the DISCLOSURE half. Same
shape, opposite failure, different fixes: strip comments there, never emit the match
here. `[R:names-travel-with-the-quote]` is the third face of the same identifier -- not
printing it, but writing it down somewhere with a wider audience.
