A sync that does not know which side is newer is not a sync, and the flags that make it unattended are exactly the ones that remove the last chance to notice."

Any script that writes a mirror, template, or snapshot onto a live target must refuse when the target is newer than the source, and must say which side is behind. Direction is the property that has to be checked; sameness is not.

Showing a diff is not a guard. A diff reveals *what* differs and never *which side is authoritative*, and a human clicking through a prompt cannot see modification times, provenance, or which copy anyone has been editing. Approving a diff feels like a decision and supplies none of the information the decision needs.

Where a live authority exists -- a global configuration, a production dataset, a running deployment -- the template must lose unconditionally, and the force flag must not reach it. A flag that overrides a directional guard will be used, by the person who is most sure and least informed, on the day the guard was right.

Ask before writing such a push: *if my copy is the stale one, what does this destroy, and would anything tell me?* The characteristic damage is that the answer is nothing: the operation succeeds, reports success, and the loss is discovered later by someone looking for a change they know they made. This is the directional sibling of R:generate-guards-unversioned -- that rule guards against destroying content that exists nowhere else, this one against destroying the newer of two copies that both exist.
