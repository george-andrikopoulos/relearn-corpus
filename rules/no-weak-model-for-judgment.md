The practice: a task requiring judgement — reviewing a design, deciding whether two rules contradict, weighing an argument — is not the place to economise on capability, because the failure mode is a confident answer that is wrong in a way nobody checks. It is distinct from choosing a model by measured cost per completed task: that rule governs how to choose, this one governs where the choice must not be made on price at all."

Work that needs judgment goes to a capable model. Do not embed a sub-tier local LLM (a 7B/13B behind Ollama, llama.cpp or similar) in a tool as a convenient, API-key-free fallback: a meaningfully dumber model degrades the tool it is wedged into, everywhere and silently, and the output looks like ordinary tool output rather than like a downgrade. When a tool needs intelligence, delegate to the capable model through the existing subscription -- the MCP server is the abstraction boundary and clients are peers. Note that the cost argument usually offered for the local model is the price-tier fallacy R:measure-cost-per-task names; but this rule is not an economic one and does not dissolve if the sums come out favourably. Mechanical, tool-restricted passes are a different matter and may be scoped tightly; the floor applies to work where the answer is a judgement.
