It surfaced in an audit of an emitted instruction pack, which carried no rule about that discipline at all while the type-design half was fully present — so one of the two disciplines the author works by reached every assistant and the other reached none. The practice: a fixed sequence of checks runs on every change rather than at a release, and a skipped one is declared rather than silently dropped. It is not hypothetical even in the repository that codified it: a change landing a rule about lying artefacts updated some of its own documents and not others, on the day that rule shipped."

A change is not done until five checks pass, in order:

1. **Code and its enforcing artefact ship together.** The type, property or test that locks the new behaviour is in the same change. Never "tests later" -- later is a different change, made by someone with less context, competing against new work.
2. **Regression pass.** Re-read the behaviour contract and *run* the enforcing artefacts of every feature this change could plausibly touch. A fix that breaks another documented feature is not a fix. This is the check that makes the contract protective rather than descriptive.
3. **The contract is updated** -- a new entry with its artefact, or an existing entry's artefact revised.
4. **Charter and architecture sync.** Ask explicitly whether the charter could still recreate the project and whether the architecture still describes it, and append any decision made to the log with its why.
5. **The open-work list is updated** -- done items cleared, discovered work added.

State the five results at the end of the task, briefly. The statement is not ceremony: it is what makes a skipped check visible to the person who can price the skip.

When a request conflicts with the discipline -- *just patch it quickly* -- do the patch, then say which checks were skipped and what exposure that creates. Never silently drop the discipline, and never block the user with process. The skip is the user's call to make; concealing that it happened is not.

Checks 1 and 2 do not apply to every change, and saying so is part of doing them. A documentation-only change has no enforcing artefact to ship. Declaring a check inapplicable is honest; quietly omitting it and reporting five greens is the failure this rule names.
