Domain types have private fields. The only way to construct one is a smart constructor that enforces the invariant and returns a `Result`; the only way to read one is an accessor.

A `pub` field is a second constructor that checks nothing. Every guarantee the smart constructor establishes is void the moment a caller can write the field directly, and the type's name goes on claiming it. This is the same defect as a validator that some call sites skip, moved from the function layer down to the field layer, where it is harder to see.

Hand out the narrowest borrow the caller can use: `fn host(&self) -> &str`, not `&String`, and never `&mut` on a field the invariant depends on. Where a caller genuinely must change the value, give it a method that re-establishes the invariant, or one that consumes the value and mints a new one.

R:parse-dont-validate is what the constructor does; this rule is what makes it the only door.
