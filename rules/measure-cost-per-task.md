incident = "A model was chosen by its price tier rather than by what it consumed on the work. Measured against the task actually being run, the cheaper-per-token model used two to three times the tokens to reach the same result, making the more expensive one both cheaper per completed task and better — so the assignment that looked like a saving was a loss in both directions. A verbose model that triples token use, or fails and needs a retry, is dearer than a flagship that lands it once."

Do not pick a mechanism or model by reputation or sticker price. State what it actually costs to complete the task -- tokens consumed times price, including retries -- and choose on that measured cost. After choosing, run one failure-mode check: under what configuration does this cause the exact harm it was chosen to prevent? Then bound that configuration.
