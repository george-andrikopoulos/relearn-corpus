Before writing logic, design the types so invalid states cannot be constructed: sum types over boolean flags, one field that cannot contradict another. If two fields can disagree, redesign until they cannot. R:no-sentinel-values is the corollary -- an absent or stopped state is an enum variant, not a magic value the surrounding logic must remember to special-case.
