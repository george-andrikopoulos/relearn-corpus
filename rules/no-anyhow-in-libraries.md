incident = "A recurring class strong enough to graduate to a deterministic control. A catch-all error type in a library's public signatures hides exactly what can go wrong, so a caller cannot match on the cases and ends up parsing prose that changes the next time somebody edits a message. The guarantee moved out of the instruction layer and into a write-time hook that blocks the pattern in library code, because an instruction is only as good as the attention of whoever is reading it that day."

Library crates return typed error enums (thiserror), so a Result says exactly what can go wrong and callers can match on it. anyhow belongs only at the outermost binary edge. This rule has graduated: the no-anyhow-in-lib hook now enforces it deterministically at write time.
