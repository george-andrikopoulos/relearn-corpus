Read a check's own verdict, never a status that merely travelled beside it.

A gate can be entirely correct and still certify a failure, because the verdict is lost
between the check and the decision. `gate | tail` exits with the status of `tail`. An
`&&` placed after such a pipeline tests the filter rather than the gate, so the action it
was meant to guard runs regardless. And a filter narrow enough to be readable will crop
the verdict out of the very output it was meant to summarise: the header carrying the
word FAILED scrolls away, and what remains is a few detail lines that read like ordinary
progress.

Nothing is forged here and nothing is unenforced -- the check ran, it was right, and its
answer never arrived. That is what separates this from its two neighbours:
`R:guarantee-needs-a-reader` fires when no check exists, `R:wired-artifact` when one
exists and accepts the wrong evidence, and this one when a correct check's answer does
not survive the trip to the reader.

The same failure runs in the other direction for commands that change things. A
substitution whose pattern matches nothing, an in-place edit against an absent string, a
rename with no candidates: every one of them exits zero. An exit code reports that the
program ran, not that the work happened.

So: run a gate unfiltered and let its own status stand. Where the output must be
filtered, make the pipeline report the gate -- enable pipefail, or read the first stage's
status explicitly -- and never place a filter between a gate and an `&&`. After a command
whose purpose is to change a file, verify the change by reading the file back, not the
status the command returned.

Failure-mode check: **what does this exit code actually measure?** If the answer names
the last stage of a pipeline, or names "the program ran" rather than "the work was done",
there is no evidence yet.
