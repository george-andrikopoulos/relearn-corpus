incident = "Validation scattered across call sites drifts: one site tightens, another is added without it, and an interior re-check that disagrees with the boundary check is a latent bug that reads as defensive programming. The remedy is to transform input into a type whose existence proves the check happened, once, at the perimeter — after which no interior code can be written that skips it, because there is nothing to skip."

Transform raw input into a rich domain type at the outermost boundary, producing a witness newtype whose existence proves the check happened. Interior code takes the witness and never re-checks -- one perimeter, one check, enforced everywhere after by the compiler. R:parse-wide-then-range-check sharpens this: the boundary must be able to see the illegal value in order to name it.
